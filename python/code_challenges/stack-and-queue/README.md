# Stacks and Queues

- Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

- Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.

- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated. This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.

## Approach & Efficiency

My approch is descriped in my code: [code](./stack_and_queue/stack_and_queue.py)



## API

#### My stack and queue class has 4 methods:

- `pop()`

- `push()`

- `peek()`

- `is_empty()`
